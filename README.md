# Object-Orient

## [Wikipedia History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
Terminology invoking "objects" and "oriented" in the modern sense of object-oriented programming made its first appearance at MIT in the late 1950s and early 1960s. 


## To say in brief
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that has been developed by a number of researchers and engineers over the years. The concept of OOP has been around for several decades, but it was not until the 1980s that it began to gain widespread acceptance.

The first object-oriented programming language is generally considered to be [Simula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula), which was developed by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard at the Norwegian Computing Center in the 1960s. Simula was designed for creating simulations and modeling real-world systems, and introduced many of the concepts that are still used in modern OOP languages, such as classes, objects, and inheritance.

Other notable early contributors to OOP include Alan Kay, who developed the Smalltalk programming language in the 1970s, and Bjarne Stroustrup, who created C++ in the 1980s. Today, OOP is one of the most widely used programming paradigms and has become an essential tool for building software systems in a wide range of industries.
